ZipDown
by Michael Nutt <michael@nuttnet.net>

This extension adds inline support for zipfiles in the download manager.  By clicking on the down arrow, you can
see a listing of the archive's files and launch them.

TODO:
  - Support for extracting folders recursively.  Necessary for double-clicking Mac .app executables
  - Drag-and-drop to desktop
